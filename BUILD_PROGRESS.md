## ⭐ QUICK START FOR NEXT SESSION ⭐

### Current Status (Session End):
- ✅ **Phases 0-5 COMPLETE** (41.7% done)
- ✅ **8 views implemented** (Tree, Table, Raw, Diff, Query, Schema, Diagram, Graph)
- ✅ **All builds passing**
- 🎯 **NEXT: Phase 6 - Treemap, Heatmap & Timeline**

### Where We Left Off:
```
Last completed: Phase 5 - Graph View with entity relationships
Last commit:    fed626f - docs: update BUILD_PROGRESS with Phase 5 completion
Status:         All tests passing, ready for Phase 6
```

### To Resume Next Time:

1. **Navigate to project:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/oneknight/projects/jsonLens
   ```

2. **Check current state:**
   ```bash
   cat BUILD_PROGRESS.md | head -30
   git log --oneline | head -5
   ```

3. **Start development:**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV= npm run dev  # Remember to unset NODE_ENV!
   ```

4. **Look for the marker:**
   - Search this file for: "⚠️ RESUME HERE"
   - That's Phase 6 - start there

5. **Build before committing:**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV= npm run build
   ```

### Phase 6 Quick Notes:
- Install: recharts or visx for visualizations
- Create: data profiler for statistics
- Build: 3 new view components (treemap, heatmap, timeline)
- Focus: Data profiling and temporal analysis

### Important Reminders:
- All phase commits follow format: `phase<N>: <short summary>`
- No emojis in code, no tags/mentions in commits
- Run `NODE_ENV= npm run build` before committing
- Update this file after each phase completion
